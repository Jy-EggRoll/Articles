# 问问自己（Ask yourself）

文章究竟是什么？我写了这么久的东西，真的配被称之为一篇文章吗？对世界保持好奇，才能写出好的文章，我并没有做到这一点。我每天只是在浑浑噩噩地度日，写出来的东西空洞无物，这对我无疑是一种打击。

What exactly is an article? Does what I've been writing for so long really deserve to be called an article? Staying curious about the world is what makes for good writing, and I wasn't doing that. I was just muddling through each day, and the emptiness of what I was writing was definitely hitting me.

最近并没有在微信公众号上发布文章，应为我觉得，一是并没有什么可以表达的，二是我不认为自己写的能被称得上是一篇“文章”。所以，我决定暂时停止公众号上文章的更新。我决定，既然要写，就不能每天写写流水账，要尽力写出有深度、有内涵的文章。

Recently, I haven't been posting articles on WeChat public account, because I feel that there is nothing to say, and I don't believe that what I've written can be called an "article". So, I decided to stop posting articles on WeChat public account. I decided that if I'm going to write, I can't just write daily blogs, but I have to write something meaningful and deep.
